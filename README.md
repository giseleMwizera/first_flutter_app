# Flutter Basics Project

This is a simple Flutter project that I built to learn and practice the basics of Flutter development. The project covers fundamental concepts and features of Flutter, including widgets, layouts, navigation, and more.

## Project Description

The Flutter Basics project is a collection of small apps or screens that demonstrate different Flutter concepts. Each app/screen focuses on a specific topic and provides a practical example of how to implement it using Flutter.

## Features

The project includes the following features and concepts:

- Widget creation and customization
- Layouts and UI composition
- Handling user input and gestures
- Navigation and routing between screens
- State management techniques (e.g., setState, Provider, or BLoC pattern)


## Getting Started

To run the Flutter Basics project locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Flutter SDK is installed on your machine. If not, refer to the official [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for instructions.

2. Clone the project repository to your local machine:
- git clone https://github.com/giseleMwizera/first_flutter_app.git

3. Navigate to the project directory:
cd flutter-basics

4. Install the project dependencies:
- flutter pub get


5. Connect a physical device or start an emulator/simulator.

6. Run the project:

- flutter run


7. The app should now be running on your device/emulator, and you can explore different screens to learn about various Flutter basics.
